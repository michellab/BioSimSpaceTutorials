    "The previous notebook showed you how to write a node to perform minimisation of a molecular system within an interactive Jupyter notebook.

    "## Running nodes on the command-line\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical way of interacting with BioSimSpace is by running a workflow component, or _node_, from the command-line. A node is just a normal Python script that is run using the `python` interpreter. Let's use the molecular minimisation example from the previous notebook, which we've provided as a Python script called `minimisation.py` within `nodes` directory. (This is the just the previous notebook, downloaded as a regular Python script.)\n",

    "From the command-line, we can query the node to see what it does and get information about the inputs:"

    "In the previous notebook, input was achieved via a graphical user interface where the user could configure options and upload files. On the command-line, inputs must be set as command-line arguments. From the information provided in the node itself, i.e. the description, the definition of inputs and outputs, BioSimSpace has autogenerated a nicely formatted [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) help message that describes how the node works. The information shows all of the inputs and outputs, let's us know which inputs are optional, and specifies any default values or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it's possible to pass options to the node in various ways, e.g. directly on the command-line, using a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) configuration file, or even using environment variables. This provides a lot of flexibility in the way in which BioSimSpace nodes can be run. For now we'll just pass arguments on the command-line."
