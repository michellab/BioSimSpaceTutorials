    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will learn how to use BioSimSpace to set up a molecular system ready for simulation. Starting from a molecular topology in the form of a [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) format file, we will learn how to parameterise molecules using different molecular [force fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(chemistry)), then solvate them using various [water models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note regarding molecular input\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for many simulations is a molecular topology in the form of a [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) file. This file contains information regarding the structure of the molecule (its constituent residues and atoms), the layout of atoms in space (in the form of 3D atomic coordinates), and sometimes additional molecular information such as the formal charge of each atom. What this file does not contain is information describing how the atoms in the molecule _interact_, i.e. what are the functional forms and parameters for the terms in the molecular potential. This file is then used as the input to a _parameterisation engine_, which typically matches the atoms and residues against templates in order to _parameterise_ the molecule with a chosen force field. As such, the accuracy of the original topology is of critical importance: Atoms and residues _must_ have the correct names, and the topology _must_ be complete, i.e. no missing atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, many tools do a poor job in preparing PDB files, e.g. having quirks with their naming conventions, excluding certain atoms, etc. Since it is impossible to account for all such inconsistencies, which often takes detailed knowledge of the particular system and tool in question, BioSimSpace takes the approach that the original files used to create a starting moleular system should be properly formatted from the outset. We don't want to make guesses as to what the user intended, or leave them confused if unexpected behaviour occurs later down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pre-processing of the PDB file is required, then we recommend using one of the following third-party tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pdb4amber](https://github.com/Amber-MD/pdb4amber)\n",
    "* [PDBFixer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer/blob/master/Manual.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "When present, we do provide rudimentary support for `pdb4amber` via the `BioSimSpace.IO.reaadPDB` function, where passing the `pdb4amber=True` argument will pre-process the file with `pdb4amber` prior to creating a molecular system. However, we choose only to support the _default_ options, since many are experimental and have can have undesirable knock-on effects, e.g. using the `--add-missing-atoms` option strips all chain identifiers from the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameterisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [BioSimSpace.Parameters](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Parameters.html) package provides support for parameterising molecules using three different engines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [AmberTools](https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) (Using the `tLEaP` and `antechamber` programs.)\n",
    "* [gmx pdb2gmx](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-pdb2gmx.html) (Used as a fall-back for certain AMBER force fields when AmberTools isn't present.)\n",
