    "# Nodes: _Interoperable workflow components_\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been working with BioSimSpace in a rather ad hoc fashion. While this intereactive exploration is a great way of learning and prototyping ideas, it is not a good way of producing a reproducible and interoperable script that can be shared with others. For example, we created processes that used specific packages such as AMBER and GROMACS. If a user didn't have these available on their system, then the script simply wouldn't work. We also used hard-coded paths to input files. This means the user would have to edit the paths each time they ran the script with different input, which would quickly become tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem, a core concept of BioSimSpace is the interoperable workflow component, or _node_. These are robust and portable Python scripts that typically do a small, well-defined piece of work. All inputs and outputs from the node are validated and the node is written in a such a way that it is _independent_ of the underlying software packages, i.e. the same script can work with a range of different packages. In addition, nodes are aware of the environment in which they are run, so can be used interactively, from the command-line, or within a workflow engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to write a node directly as a Python script, we suggest that the best way of writing one is inside of a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook, like this. As you've already seen, the interactive notebook environment provides a fantastic way of prototyping and documenting your node and will allow a user to interact with it directly on a remote cloud server, such as [notebook.biosimspace.org](https://notebook.biosimspace.org). The notebook can provide a complete record of your work, inlcuding documentation, visualisation, and graphs. When you are happy with the node, you can download it as a regular Python script (by clicking on `File/Download As/Python` in JupyterHub or `File/Export Notebook As/Export Notebook to Executable Script` in JupyterLab) and run it directly from the command-line on your workstation, laptop, or on a high-performance computing cluster. Any interactive BioSimSpace elements, such as molecular visualisations, will simply be ignored when run this way.\n",

    "## An example: Minimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the notebook you'll learn how to use BioSimSpace to write a robust and interoperable workflow node to perform energy minimisation on a molecular system.\n",

    "When working interactively within a Jupyter notebook we need a way to allow users to set the input requirements. The `node.showControls` method will display a graphical user interface (GUI), from which inputs can be set. All of the elements for this GUI are automatically generated by the `addInput` and `addOutput` functions above. As you'll see in the next notebook, if we were to run the same node from the command-line, we would instead get an automatically generated [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) parser.\n",

Since Jupyter has a limit of 5MB for file transfers, we provide support for compressed formats, such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. (A single archive can contain a set of files, allowing you to set a single value for a `FileSet` requirement.)
