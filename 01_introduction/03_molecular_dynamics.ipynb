    "One of the key goals of BioSimSpace was to start a conversation regarding _best practice_ within the biomolecular simulation community and to facilitate the codifying of shareable, re-usable, and extensible simulation protocols.\n",

    "Since we require protocols to be _interoperable_, the classes listed above are simple objects that allow you to configure a _limited_ set of options that are handled by _all_ of the molecular dynamics engines that we support. This might seem quite restrictive, but we will see later how it is possible to fully customise a simulation for a particular molecular dynamics engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each protocol comes with some default options. To see what those are we can instantiate an object using the default constructor. For example, let's explore the [Equilibration](https://biosimspace.org/api/generated/BioSimSpace.Protocol.Equilibration.html#BioSimSpace.Protocol.Equilibration) protocol."

    "Here we can see that the default protocol performs an equlibration at fixed temperature (`temperature_start == temperature_end`) in the NVT ensemble (`pressure=None`) with no restraints (`restraint=None`). The total simulation time is 0.2 nanoseconds with an integration timestep of 2 femtoseconds. The `report_interval` and `restart_interval` govern how frequently information is written to log and restart (and/or trajectory) files respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these defaults are unsuitable, then you are free to change them by passing in appropriate values for each of the arguments when instantiating the object. In some cases it might be desirable to _override_ the default protocols and set specific values of the arguments that are suitable for a particular project or team. This can be achieved by defining a set of function wrappers that configure and return the protocols using your own defaults.\n",
