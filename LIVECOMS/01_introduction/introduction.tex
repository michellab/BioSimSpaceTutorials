%%%% FOR SUBCHAPTERS, USE \subsubsection{subchapter name}

%%%% YOU CAN USE THIS BLOCK FOR PYTHON:
\begin{python}
import numpy as np
    
def incmatrix(genl1,genl2):
    M = []
    m = len(genl1)  # comment 
    for i in m:
        M.append(i)
    
    return M
\end{python}

%%%% YOU CAN USE THIS BLOCK FOR BASH:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ command -arg1 -arg2 -arg3 -arg4 -arg5 -arg6 > output.file 2> err.file
\end{lstlisting}

%%%% YOU CAN USE THE SAME BLOCK FOR TEXT (e.g. STDOUT):
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=flexible]
this is an example of a message printed to StdOut!
\end{lstlisting}


%%%% FOR LARGE CHUNKS OF TEXTS, USE \scriptsize{} (OR EVEN \tiny{}) TO MAKE IT FIT THE COLUMNS
