BioSimSpace does not provide the functionality to perform such analysis, but the code used to generate these plots is available [here](https://github.com/fjclark/abfe_analysis/blob/main/abfe_analysis/get_data/convergence_data.py) (provided purely as an example - reuse is not suggested).\n",

As a result, the systems do not have enough time to relax from starting configurations which would otherwise have a very low probability of being sampled.

Further analysis reveals this is the region at which the ligand becomes \"soft\" enough and water begins to enter the binding site. Slow equilibration likely occurs because the partially vanished ligand needs to be \"pushed\" to the side of the binding site to allow water in, which happens slowly. At higher values of $\\lambda$, the ligand's intermolecular interactions are extremely weak and water is able to quickly enter the binding site.\n",

If there is equilibrium sampling of all symmetry-related regions of configurations space as the restraints are introduced then a correction is not required, and if there is partial sampling then this represents a sampling issue. For example, imagine we have a ligand with two symmetry-related binding modes. If restraints are introduced which completely prevent sampling of one of the poses, and this pose is not sampled at all as the restraints are turned on, then a symmetry correction of $-k_BT\\ln2$ is required.

If we were to ignore the remaining binding sites, we would underestimate the probability of the ligand binding by a factor of 3, and therefore underestimate the free energy of binding by $-k_BT\\ln3 = 0.65 $ kcal mol $^{-1}$.

However, as we have discussed above, the \"correct\" answer for our model in the limit of infinite sampling will be different to the experimental value, and our final answer is a far more rigorous estimate of this value with a far more realistic estimate of the random error arising from incomplete sampling. While not within \"chemical accuracy\" (1 kcal mol $^{-1}$) of the experimental result, our final answer shows reasonable agreement with experiment."
