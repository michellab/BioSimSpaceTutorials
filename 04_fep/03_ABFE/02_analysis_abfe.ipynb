Performing more sampling by increasing the simulation time should not add any new information and our estimate should not change. This can be checked by repeatedly truncating the data at a given simulation time and analysing the free energy change with the remaining data. The results are plotted for the bound stages, where the blue line shows the average over all runs and the beige fill indicates the 95 % t-based confidence intervals. BioSimSpace does not provide the functionality to perform such analysis, but the code used to generate these plots is available [here](https://github.com/fjclark/abfe_analysis/blob/main/abfe_analysis/get_data/convergence_data.py) (provided purely as an example - reuse is not suggested).\n",

    "There seems to be some drift with increasing simulation time for the vanish stage especially. In addition, within all runs, all stages evolve in the same direction with increasing simulation time at early values of total simulation time. This is because we have completely failed to include any equilibration time for each $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ window! As a result, the systems do not have enough time to relax from starting configurations which would otherwise have a very low probability of being sampled. To avoid this biasing our simulations, we should discard an initial portion of each trajectory as equilibration (or perform short equilibration simulations for each $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ window).\n",

    "We can also check how the PMF changes with increasing total simulation time for each run. For example, for run 1:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/pmf_evolution.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the bound vanish stage, the rate of divergence of the PMF is by far the greatest around $\\lambda = 0.4$, which tells us that $\\lambda$ windows in this region take far longer to equilibrate than those before or afterwards. Further analysis reveals this is the region at which the ligand becomes \"soft\" enough and water begins to enter the binding site. Slow equilibration likely occurs because the partially vanished ligand needs to be \"pushed\" to the side of the binding site to allow water in, which happens slowly. At higher values of $\\lambda$, the ligand's intermolecular interactions are extremely weak and water is able to quickly enter the binding site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis was repeated after discarding the initial 1 ns (of 6 ns) for the restrain and discharge stages, and the initial 3 ns (of 8 ns) for the vanish stage. Greater equilibration time was required for the vanish stage in order to allow water to enter the binding site.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/convergence_equil.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the initial correlation between the time evolution of the repeat runs, and results in average estimates (blue line) for the vanish and discharge stages which show no clear drift with time, suggesting that we have achieved convergence. There appears to be some drift for the restrain stage, although the gradient is very shallow. With equilibration, we found $\\Delta\\textit{G}_{\\textrm{Bind}}^o=-9.03 \\pm 1.06$ kcal mol $^{-1}$ (95 % t-based confidence interval). Note that because `Absolute.analyse()` discards only the first 5 % of the trajectory by default for SOMD, this analysis shows that our previous results will be subject to bias resulting from including the unequilibrated portion of the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating this analysis in reverse and comparing with the analysis in the forward direction can be helpful for diagnosing insufficient equilibration time.\n",
    "\n",
    "While reassuring, it should be noted that a lack of drift of the free energy estimate with respect to increasing simulation time does not guarantee converged sampling - it may be that transitions to other important configurations are not sampled on the timescale of the simulations.\n",

For example, imagine we have a ligand with two symmetry-related binding modes. If restraints are introduced which completely prevent sampling of one of the poses, and this pose is not sampled at all as the restraints are turned on, then a symmetry correction of $-k_BT\\ln2$ is required.

However, as we have discussed above, the \"correct\" answer for our model in the limit of infinite sampling will be different to the experimental value, and our final answer is a far more rigorous estimate of this value with a far more realistic estimate of the random error arising from incomplete sampling. While not within \"chemical accuracy\" (1 kcal mol $^{-1}$) of the experimental result, our final answer shows reasonable agreement with experiment.      \n",
