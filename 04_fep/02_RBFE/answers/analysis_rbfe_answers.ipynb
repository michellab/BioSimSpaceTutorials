    "Once we have obtained our results, we want to analyse them. The basics of this analysis using `BSS.FreeEnergy.Relative.analyse()` for both MBAR and TI, as well as plotting overlap matrices, have already been covered in the introduction to alchemistry part of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will look at how to carry out a large scale network analysis. As it would take some time to run the analysis for each perturbation, the [runs from this paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62ec4b0eadfd35eddd272954) have already been analysed using BSS to give the MBAR RBFE result and error in a csv file format. It is best practice to run repeats of the simulations, which is why there are multiple results files, one for each repeat. The files 'analysis/repeat_{r}_tyk2.csv' contain the results for this 'analysis/network_full.dat'. These runs are from a very large network, with some different ligands than we used for the first part of this RBFE tutorial. This is included incase you want to create a different network and analyse how the output changes based on the edges chosen. However, in this tutorial we will not be analysing this whole large network and we have a different network file to describe the inital network we want to consider, generated using LOMAP, in 'analysis/network.dat', with the ligands from 'inputs/ligands/analysis_ligands'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a csv file with the experimental results for these ligands. In cases where experimental data is available, for instance when benchmarking a new protein-ligand set, we would like to compare how well FEP is predicting with respect to these data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to set the file paths to our results and experimental data. We also want to create a list of the perturbations and of ligands so we can use/edit these throughout the analysis.\n"
