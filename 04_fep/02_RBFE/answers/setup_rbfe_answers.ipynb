                "Computational chemists can support structure-activity relationship studies in medicinal chemistry by making computer models that can predict binding affinity of ligands to proteins. One of the most popular techniques for this is Free Energy Perturbation (FEP), which relies on simulation alchemical transformations of ligands in a congeneric series, simulating them both in a protein target and in just a waterbox. Relative free energies of binding (ΔΔG in kcal/mol) can then be computed by simply subtracting the ΔG (in protein) and the ΔG (in water). The basics of setting up and running an FEP calculation with BSS have already been covered in the `introduction_to_alchemistry` part of this workshop.\n",
                "\n",
                "In the previous section of the workshop, we only looked at a singular perturbation. However, typically in FEP the goal is to predict free energies of binding for a collection of ligands (normally 10-20). Although methods exist (such as absolute FEP, which is covered in the `absolute_binding_free_energies` part of this workshop) that can predict these energies directly (i.e. ΔGbind), these are often complicated and computationally expensive, whilst relative binding free energies are more accessible to run and give useful results as we are usually considering a congeneric series of ligands. Because we calculate relative energies, we therefore have to transform the between pairs of ligands in both the free and bound phase (hence the name free energy perturbation). Typically, smaller (i.e. fewer heavy atoms) transformations are more reliable, which means that for a ligand series we want to selectively make combinations of ligands to cover the whole series. In RBFE, we do this using perturbation networks, typically generated by FEP softwares. Although generate these networks can be done by hand, it is typically better to do it programmatically to save time and create better networks (transformation reliability does not depend just on transformation size, but also a series of other unfavourable moiety transformations).   \n",

Then, after running and processing the FEP outputs, the results are usually downloaded back to our local workstation. There, the analysis notebook is used to process FEP predictions and generate plots. As already mentioned, this part of the workshop only focuses on the setup of the pipeline, however how to run these simulations is also explained in more detail at the end of the notebook.\n"

We can see that for the above network, if we have remove the two worst edges in terms of LOMAP score ('ejm42 ~ ejm54' and 'ejm31 ~ ejm54'), we wouldn't actually have any perturbations left with ligand 'ejm54'. At the same time when editing the network, we may decide to add more perturbations for ligands that only have a single transformation, for example 'ejm50'. However, if any other perturbations were a good idea, LOMAP might have already included these in the first place. Overtime as you gain experience, editing the network will become easier.      \n",

This makes it easier for the FEP code to perturb to cyclical R-groups.
