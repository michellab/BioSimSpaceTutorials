    "The purpose of the steered MD simulation is to access conformational space that would take a very long time (or be inaccessible altogether) at equilibrium. To generate the data for the Markov State Model, we need to see how the system behaves given some starting conformation. To do this, we will be running seeded MD simulations, where a snapshot from the sMD trajectory is used as a starting point for an equilibrium MD simulation."

Additionally, the Tyr152 $\\chi$1 angle was kept in the \"down\" rotamer consistently (around 1.1 radians) and the Phe196(C$\\gamma$)-Phe280(C$\\gamma$) distance was decreased to 4 A, which corresponds to the two residues $\\pi$-stacking.\n",
