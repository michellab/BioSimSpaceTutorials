Therefore, we have to perform dimensionality reduction in the form of featurising data, i.e. reducing the trajectories to time series of feature values. In this case we will be using RMSD to the closed WPD loop PTP1B conformation (backbone atoms only), and the distance between peptide substrate PTry(P) and Cys215(S) of the protein. These have been chosen as the starting point based on the specific function of PTP1B and will depend on each system."
